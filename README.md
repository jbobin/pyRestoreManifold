# pyRestoreManifold

## **Toolbox for solving restoration problems for manifold-valued data**

***

This toolbox is composed of the following packages:

- pyRestoreManifold: used for restoration problems on Manifolds including the following
modules:

   - utils : utility functions
   - wrappers: wrappers to C++ code
   - trans: transforms on Manifolds
   - restore: algorithms for restoration problems

- pyStarlet: used to perform starlet transform on manifolds, directly using C++ wrappers
